# README IS WORK IN PROGRESS TO BE UPDATED SOON (5/17/19)

# Miscellaneous-Scripts
Collection of small scripts not large enough to have their own repository
All scripts should be considered very alpha code, and may not be in the best state for use depending on when they were last touched. Please contact me if you're interested in using a script and I can tweak it or explain the specific use-case for them.
