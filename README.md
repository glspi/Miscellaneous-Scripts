# README IS WORK IN PROGRESS TO BE UPDATED SOON (5/17/19)

# Miscellaneous-Scripts
Collection of small scripts not large enough to have their own repository
All scripts should be considered beta code. Although they should generally be safe for production usage, please contact me if you're interested and I can tweak code and/or explain the specific use-case for them as well as how they are used.
